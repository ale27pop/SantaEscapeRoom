üéÖ Santa's Escape Room
Santa's Escape Room is a grid-based puzzle game where players guide Santa to collect presents, avoid obstacles, and outsmart the Grinch to escape through the chimney. This project combines manual gameplay with AI-driven autonomous navigation powered by Prover9, a logical theorem prover.

üåü Features
Manual Gameplay: Navigate Santa through the grid using arrow keys.
Autonomous Mode: Activate AI to let Santa solve the puzzle using logic-based navigation.
Dynamic Clues: Visual indicators like cookie smells, cold breezes, and flour traps guide gameplay.
Randomized Grinch Movement: The Grinch creates dynamic danger zones.
Win/Lose Conditions: Collect all presents and escape or get caught by the Grinch.

üß† How It Works

Clue-Based Navigation:
Cookie Smell (Yellow): Indicates presents nearby.
Flour Smell (Gray): Warns of obstacles.
Cold Breeze (Blue): Guides Santa to the exit.
Grinch Sound (Green): Alerts Santa of the Grinch‚Äôs proximity.


Prover9 Integration:
Logical reasoning determines the safest move for Santa in autonomous mode.
Clues and grid relationships are processed to validate moves.
